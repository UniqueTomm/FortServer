# FortDashboard

This is a rewrite of the current dashboard to implement better things... blazor has the "Lack" of support and "SHOULDNT" be in c# 

# ENV

AUTH_KEY is DashboardAuth on FortBackend (CONFIG)
Both is required to be same... if you dont change it others "could" grab it.... i will force users to change it in the future

# TODO (these could happen or never ykky)
- Rewrite again but in electron/vue
