# FortBackend (still needs improviing)

# About
- Supports http and https!
- Universal Backend (aiming for season 3 - 15/?!?! but expand after hitting to a basic state)
- STW is aimed at the very end and might never actually be implemented

# HTTP
- Just build on Release or Debug

# HTTPS
- First go to [FortBackend/src/resources/certificates](https://github.com/zinx28/FortBackend/tree/main/FortBackend/src/Resources/Certificates)
- Remove .temp from the file then replace it with your .pfx (If you have cert and the key just look up how to make it a pfx)
- Before you run the project make sure you change the build type from (Debug or Release) to HTTPS
