# FortBackend (still needs improviing)

# About
- Supports http and https!
- Universal Backend (aiming for season 3 - 15/?!?! but expand after hitting to a basic state)
- STW is aimed at the very end and might never actually be implemented

# Http and https
- Supports http and https!
- FortBackend/src/resource/cert/yourcert.pfx eh it works trust... i've tried with cosmos
- if you have the cert and key then just search to make it a pfx not hard
- Build on https if https duh  

# Devers and devers!
- Build on x64 (Release or debug NOT https on http)
- DO not update the config.json instead build the project do to the x64... resources/config and change it there then restart the backend after! :) if you ever need to clean the solution then just backup the file~ discord bot tokens, secrets are so secret kiddo

# Added/Not Added 
- MCP (QueryProfle, Equiping and useless things) [!]
- Timeline [+]
- CloudStorage and Saving [X]
- 24/7 Shop (WIP - could be so random, items in wrong places)
