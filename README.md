# FortBackend (Read me will be sh~~ for a bit)

- Universal Backend (aiming for season 3 - 15/?!?! but expand after hitting to a basic state)

- STW is aimed at the very end and might never actually be implemented

- Build on x64

# Supports Https and Http!
- FortBackend/src/resource/cert/yourcert.pfx eh it works trust... i've tried with cosmos
- if you have the cert and key then just search to make it a pfx not hard
- Build on https if https duh
