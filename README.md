FortBackend is a Universal Fortnite Private Server Backend writen in C#

# Some features may break over time while when i have a chance these issues will be fixed

- Save the world (STW) is aimed at the very end and might never actually be implemented

# Discord Bot
- Make sure you setup the bot in the configs... and /test command works

### Commands
- /test
- /who (this command only works if the user has a role... lets say helpers.. ig)

# HTTP
- Just build on Release or Debug

# HTTPS
- First go to [FortBackend/src/resources/certificates](https://github.com/zinx28/FortBackend/tree/main/FortBackend/src/Resources/Certificates)
- Remove .temp from the file then replace it with your .pfx (If you have cert and the key just look up how to make it a pfx)
- Before you run the project make sure you change the build type from (Debug or Release) to HTTPS
